# Changelog

- chore: The library is rewritten to TypeScript and type definitions are now not hand-written
but compiled from source code.
- feature: New `json2satrec` function that allows parsing orbital elements in
[OMM](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/orbit_data_messages.pdf) format,
**encoded as JSON**. Orbital elements in OMM format are already available for download
from Celestrak and Space-Track. `json2satrec` supports both of these sources and aims 
to support all sources of properly formatted OMM data.

To obtain OMM as JSON from Celestrak, select "JSON" option at the top of "Current GP
Element Sets" page or follow
[this link](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/index.php?FORMAT=json) where it will
be already selected.

Space-Track doesn't expose the JSON format in their UI, so to get JSON encoded OMM,
on "Recent ELSETs" page, from "Current Catalog Files", copy a URL for the needed category
and change the ending part of the URL from `/format/xml` to be `/format/json`.
- **BREAKING**: The return type of the `sgp4` and `propagate` functions is changed from:
```ts
{
  position: EciVec3<Kilometer> | false
  velocity: EciVec3<KilometerPerSecond> | false
}
```
to:
```ts
null | {
  position: EciVec3<Kilometer>
  velocity: EciVec3<KilometerPerSecond>
  meanElements: MeanElements
}
```
Where, if propagation failed, `null` is returned instead of individual keys set to `false`.
- **BREAKING**: removed overloads of `gstime` and return types of `sgp4` and `propagate` that
were not documented by TypeScript definitions as of v5.0.0, but could happen in runtime with v5.0.0.
- feature: New `SatRecError` enum that lists all error codes that can be set on `SatRec.error`.
- feature: `sgp4` and `propagate` function result object returns `meanElements` key,
which is orbit parameters as they have evolved at the propagation moment. Since they are always
internally calculated by SGP4 model, this doesn't impact performance.
- feature: New `sunPos` function that calculates Sun position at date, useful to calculate if
a satellite is in Earth umbra. Its accuracy is within 0.01 angular degree between years
1950 and 2050.
- feature: Many additional properties of `SatRec` are documented
- fix: `dopplerFactor` produces correct results depending on if the satellite is moving
towards or away from the observer.
